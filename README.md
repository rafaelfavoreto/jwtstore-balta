In this course, I learned how authentication and authorization work in ASP.NET, including key concepts such as Tokens, Claims, Roles, and Policies. I also gained a clear understanding of how JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are generated and used.

We explored all the core principles of OAuth and Bearer Authentication, implementing a comprehensive end-to-end solution.
